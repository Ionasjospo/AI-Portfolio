                        <h4>Practical Assignment 1</h4>
                        <p><strong>Exercise 1</strong><br>
                            <strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong><br>
                            I noticed that there were many attributes with missing data. First, I used the
                            “Select
                            Attributes” tool to hide/remove the attributes that were not important for this
                            tutorial.
                            Then, with the “Replace Missing Attributes” tool, I replaced the missing values with
                            the
                            median. Finally, with “Filter Examples”, we eliminated all the rows that still had
                            missing
                            columns.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Normalization and Outlier Detection:</strong><br>
                            I started by importing the dataset, then I removed some attributes that were not
                            important.
                            After that, we normalized the data to be able to apply distance-based algorithms.
                            We then connected the operator to detect outliers, linked it, and added the operator
                            “Filter
                            Examples,” where we set the outlier values to false.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Exercise 2</strong><br>
                            The first problem I encountered was that after downloading the dataset, it was not
                            downloaded as a CSV but as a .data file.
                            This was the first time I downloaded a dataset in this format, so I opened it in
                            Excel to
                            convert it to CSV.
                            I noticed that the attribute names were missing, so I looked them up in the
                            description and
                            added them. Finally, I exported it as a CSV and opened it in RapidMiner.

                            <strong>Problem:</strong><br>
                            Determine the origin of the wine based on the provided data.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Attributes:</strong><br>

                                neutralize
                                acids) in the ash.</li>
                            <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium content in the wine, in parts per million
                                (ppm).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Total phenols:</strong> Total amount of phenols, compounds affecting the
                                flavor
                                and color of the wine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flavanoids:</strong> A subgroup of phenols, important for the flavor and
                                color
                                of the wine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nonflavanoid phenols:</strong> Phenols that do not belong to the
                                flavonoid
                                group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proanthocyanins:</strong> Tannins present in wine, affecting the flavor
                                and
                                color.</li>
                            <li><strong>Color intensity:</strong> The intensity of the wine’s color.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hue:</strong> Tone of the wine’s color.</li>

                                nm and
                                315 nm, a measure related to the phenol content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proline:</strong> An amino acid that is a quality marker in wine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        RapidMiner shows in the statistics section that there are no missing values. It is also
                        observed
                        that there are no outliers, as there is no evidence in the bar charts indicating their
                        presence.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Confusion Matrix Results:</strong><br>
                        After following the steps, I obtained the confusion matrix for both cases:<br>
                        The confusion matrix is a table showing the performance of a classification model by
                        comparing
                        the predictions with the true labels, detailing true positives, false positives, true
                        negatives,
                        and false negatives for each class.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Class recall:</strong> It measures the proportion of positive instances
                        correctly
                        identified by the model, calculated as true positives divided by the sum of true
                        positives and
                        false negatives.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>For the unnormalized/standardized dataset:</strong><br>
                            <img src="../../../Assets/ut2_images/ut3_pd1_ej2.png" class="img-fluid"
                                style="width: 90%;"><br>

                            In general, the model had an accuracy of 96.00%<br>
                            For class 1 (pred1), we see that Naive Bayes had 100% accuracy, meaning it always
                            predicted
                            that the wine belonged to class 1 (vineyard 1) based on its characteristics.<br>
                            For class 2 (pred2), the model achieved 92.45% accuracy and confused class 2 with
                            class 1 on
                            four occasions.<br>
                            For class 3, the model achieved 97.14% accuracy, misclassifying class 3 as class 2
                            once.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>For the normalized and standardized dataset:</strong><br>
                            <img src="../../../Assets/ut2_images/ut3_pd1_ej2_v2.png" class="img-fluid"
                                style="width: 90%;"><br>
                            The model, after being normalized and standardized, achieved an accuracy of 98.11%.
                            It only
                            misclassified class 2 as class 1 on one occasion.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                            Preprocessing using normalization and standardization improved the model’s accuracy
                            from
                            96.00% to 98.11%. The precision and recall also increased, especially in class 1 and
                            class
                            2, indicating that the model’s classification ability improved, reducing errors.
