                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
                        Based on the Kaggle dataset available in <a
                            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017"
                            target="_blank">International Football Results from 1872 to 2017</a>, a specific analysis
                        was conducted to predict the outcomes of Uruguay's national team matches. This dataset includes
                        three CSV files, but only the ‘results’ file was used. Given that the free version of RapidMiner
                        limits visualization to the first 10,000 rows, the file was filtered to include only matches
                        involving Uruguay. This selection was performed in Excel, transforming the original CSV into one
                        containing only Uruguay matches.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Why did I choose this case study?</strong><br>
                        I chose this study because I am a fan of both football and computer science. This motivated me
                        to combine both interests into a project that uses historical match data to generate
                        predictions.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong><br>
                        Using the data provided by the dataset, the goal is to predict whether Uruguay will win, lose,
                        or draw in different matches using data analysis techniques and classification models.

                    <h6>Analysis of attributes and their distributions:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>date:</strong> Date of the match.<br>
                            The graph shows a categorical distribution of dates with similar frequencies, except for the
                            last category with a lower value. No outliers are evident.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>home_team:</strong> The name of the home team.</li>
                        <li><strong>away_team:</strong> The name of the away team.<br>
                            Home and away team distributions: The distribution of teams shows a categorical pattern,
                            where Uruguay dominates both as a home and away team, followed by Argentina, Paraguay,
                            Chile, and Brazil. Although it is only for Uruguay matches, when Uruguay is the away team,
                            another country is the home team. This is why other countries' names appear in these
                            columns. No outliers are observed.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>away_score:</strong> Final score of the away team, including extra time, but not
                            penalty shootouts.<br>
                            The distribution of home_score and away_score is right-skewed, with most scores concentrated
                            between 0 and 3 goals. There are few instances of higher scores.

                            The tournament distribution shows a higher concentration of matches in friendly tournaments,
                            followed by continental competitions. Other categories have less frequency. The distribution
                            is left-skewed. No outliers are observed, as it reflects the variety of tournaments.
                        </li>

                            played.<br>
                            The distribution of city is positively skewed, showing a high concentration of matches in
                            Montevideo, followed by Buenos Aires and other cities. This reflects Uruguay's tendency to
                            play at home. No significant outliers are observed.

                            The country distribution is positively skewed, with a high concentration in Uruguay and a
                            decrease towards other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru.

                            The distribution of the neutral variable is binary, with a predominance of *FALSE* values,
                            indicating that most of Uruguay's matches were not played at a neutral venue. No outliers
                            are present.

                    <p>Using the Generate Attributes operator, we created a new column called Uruguay_results. This
                        column indicates whether Uruguay won, drew, or lost the match. The logic within the operator is
                        as follows:</p>
                    <pre>
if(home_team == "Uruguay" && home_score > away_score, "Won",
   if(home_team == "Uruguay" && home_score < away_score, "Lost",

            "Draw"))))
                    </pre>
                    <p>The distribution is: It has a categorical distribution of Uruguay's results. The distribution
                        shows that the team has won most matches, followed by losses and, to a lesser extent, draws.</p>

                        precision (60.18%), while the "Draw" class is the lowest (29.27%). This suggests that the model
                        identifies wins better, but struggles with predicting draws. The low success rate indicates a
                        need for data optimization or testing other models to improve prediction accuracy.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-4">Conclusion</h4>
            <h6>Decision Tree vs. Naive Bayes for Predicting Uruguay's Match Outcomes</h6>
            <p>
                After incorporating a Decision Tree model alongside the Naive Bayes model, the results showed that the
                Decision Tree yielded a lower accuracy compared to the Naive Bayes approach. This suggests that, for
                this particular dataset, Naive Bayes is better at capturing the underlying patterns in the match data of
                Uruguay.
            </p>
            <h4>Possible Reasons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feature Independence:</strong> Naive Bayes assumes that all features are independent, which,
                    despite being a strong assumption, can perform well when the assumption holds reasonably true. It
                    might be more suitable for this dataset if the input features do not have strong interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Boundaries:</strong> Decision Trees tend to create hard splits and might struggle
                    when the decision boundaries between winning, losing, and drawing are not well-defined in the
                    feature space. This can lead to overfitting in the training set, causing a decrease in performance
                    on unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Distribution:</strong> The nature of football match results (win, draw, lose) may be
                    better modeled by the probabilistic approach of Naive Bayes, especially given the skewed
                    distributions in some features like scores.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Recommendation:</h4>
            <p>
                While Decision Trees offer interpretability by showing how different features influence outcomes, Naive
                Bayes seems more effective for this specific problem in terms of accuracy. To further improve model
                performance, it could be beneficial to try ensemble methods like Random Forests, which combine multiple
                decision trees and often provide better predictive power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, exploring other classification models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or even deep
                learning techniques could yield better results in predicting match outcomes.
